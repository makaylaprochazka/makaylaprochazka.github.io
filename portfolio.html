    <h1>Blown To Bits Summary</h1>
    <p>I agree that computing will transform society because, anything and 
    everything can be done digitally now without question. Computers are commonly
    used items in many areas. It is an important thing to people, especially the 
    people who run organizations, industry, etc. . . Almost anything you know is 
    run or made by computers. These 'mechanical brains' made a huge impact on our society. 
    It would be hard if we didn't have the computer around. Having the ability 
    and power of search allows you to access information beyond "'forbidden things". 
    The data you enter will remain as your digital footprint and will remain there forever.
    Though you can type anything into a search bar, your results
    that you receive could be manipulated, and not all search
    engines are equal, they don't see everything you enter. Search
    engines pay attention to mainly key- words But, computers have brought us a 
    long way, and continue to form us to the society we are becoming. </p>
